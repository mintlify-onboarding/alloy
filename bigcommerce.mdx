### Example Use Cases

1. Reward customers with over 5 subscription renewals (ReCharge) with additional gift item for their next delivery and extra loyalty points (in Yotpo or Stamped.io)
2. Text new BigCommerce customers a discount code (via Postscript or Attentive)
3. Email customers shipping updates with a corresponding AfterShip link
4. Recover abandoned checkouts with PushOwl push notifications
