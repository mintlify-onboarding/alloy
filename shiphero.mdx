Learn how to authenticate and combine ShipHero's capabilities with other apps to vastly improve your logistics & ops workflows  
In this article, you'll learn how to set up your ShipHero account to work with the Alloy platform. Once you've connected ShipHero, you'll be able to sync data from Shopify, PostScript, Gorgias, and other apps into ShipHero, and vice versa.

### Example Use Cases

Send delivery and warehousing updates via SMS to team or customers

1. Tag orders based on delivery speed
2. Auto-create shipping labels for return requests
3. Send reorder alerts to staff for low inventory
4. Sending back in stock notifications based on tags

### Authentication

For the credentials, you will need the following:

1. Access Token
2. Refresh Token

### How to get the Tokens

Shiphero requires you to add Alloy as a Third-Party Developer to the list of Users in your dashboard. To do this, in your ShipHero account, go to **My Account -> Developer Users -> Add Third-Party Developer**. You will be presented with the form below in which you need to then enter your First Name, Last Name, and your Email (e.g. Alloy, Automation, [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9dfef2f3e9fcfee9ddefe8f3fcf1f1f2e4b3fef2f0)).
