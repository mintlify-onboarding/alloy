In this article, you'll learn how to set up your Snowflake account to work with the Alloy platform. 

To obtain credentials, you will need the following:

* Account Name
* Database Name
* Data Warehouse Name
* Snowflake Username
* Snowflake Password
* Role

As you can see below, Alloy will need this information to make queries to your Snowflake warehouse. You'll want to copy/paste that information in Alloy once you have it. In this guide, we'll explore how to obtain these keys.

### (Optional) Adding Alloyâ€™s IP Address

If you have IP whitelisting on your Snowflake warehouse, you will need to whitelist Alloy servers to connect to Snowflake. To learn more about this, please read [this article](/docs/authorization#alloy-ip-addresses).

1. To enable whitelisting, first go to Admin on the sidebar and click Security
2. Click on the + Network Policy Button to add a network policy.
3. Input the IP Address under the Allowed IP Addresses
4. Then click on Create Network Policy on the pop-up to save.
