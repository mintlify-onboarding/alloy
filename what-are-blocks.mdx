title: "What are Blocks?"
---

There are four main types of blocks:

* Trigger Blocks: these blocks invoke a workflow
* Action Blocks: these blocks take a certain action when run but do not start a workflow
* Logic Blocks: these blocks are a special type of action block which perform logical operations (i.e. loop, conditional, etc)
* Utility Blocks: these blocks allow you to perform operations such as writing custom code or generating dynamic dates.
