Have you found yourself in a position where you are wanting to trigger one workflow from another? We have the answer! By combining this block with the Custom Event block, you can now take customization to a whole new level! Letâ€™s take a look at how this is done.

This possess is a two-step process and oddly enough, we are going to start with Step 2 first!

Step 2:  
We call this Step 2 because this will be the workflow that is getting triggered by another. Start by creating your workflow with a Custom Event trigger. Comprise your workflow to take the desired actions once this workflow has been invoked. Check out our article on [Custom Events](/docs/custom-events) if you are unsure of how to create one. Once you are done building this workflow, it is time to move onto Step 1.

Step 1:  
Now this workflow will be built as usual with the Trigger Another Workflow block added to the desired spot in the workflow. To trigger the second workflow from this block, you will just need to select the Custom Event from the Workflow dropdown and then the Event Schema will become present. Just finish mapping the proper variables to the schema fields and you're off to the races!
