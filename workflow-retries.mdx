title: "Workflow Retries"
---

When running executions that involve large data transfers and thousands (if not millions) of API calls, you might occasionally experience rate limits. Rate limits are a strategy employed by many 3rd party services to limit the amount of incoming traffic.

By default, Alloy has logic in place to handle rate limits. If your workflow gets rate limited at a specific block, Alloy will automatically attempt to retry the request after an arbitrary few seconds. If the rate limit continues, Alloy will continue to retry up to 20 times.

After the 20 times retry threshold is reached, Alloy Embedded logs the execution as an error. You can easily identify errors using our [GET /workflow/errors](/reference/get-workflow-errors) endpoint and re-run a failed execution with our [POST /workflows/rerun ](/reference/rerun-workfow)endpoint.
