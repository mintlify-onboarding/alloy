title: "URL Shortener"
description: "Generate a short URL to use in place of a URL"

Often times you will find yourself needing to shorten a URL as it can exceed the allowed character limit for other applications. We have a solution for just this!

Let's say you want to take an abandoned cart URL and add that cart to a store in Mailchimp. Mailchimp only allows for a URL character limit of 255 characters or less. In most cases this is easily exceeded, so to overcome that we have added a URL Shortener utility block. Just add the URL you would like to be shortened inside of the URL Shortener and the output will be a much smaller URL.

In the example above we are taking the following URL exceeding 345 characters

order.buywithprime.amazon.com/8e9gstnlil/checkout?#catalogId=catalogId&productUrl=https%3A%2F%2Falloy-automation-test-cases-store.myshopify.com%2Fproducts%2Falloy-sweater&cartId=322-6ZJ4-4R6GGC&products=W3sicHJvZHVjdElkIjoic3psM8diMjhxODE4MTMiLCJxdWFudGl0eSI6Mn0seyJwcm9kdWN0SWQiOiJ0bTl2OW9nMmpxMjAwMCIsInF1YW50aXR5IjoxfV0=&productId=123

and turning it into this much shorter URL that will be accepted virtually anywehere!
