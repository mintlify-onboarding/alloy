In this article, you'll learn how to set up your ShipBob account to work with the Alloy platform. Once you've connected ShipBob, you'll be able to sync data from Shopify, Klaviyo, Gorgias, and other apps into ShipBob, and vice versa.

### Example Use Cases

1. Sending reorder alerts to staff for low inventory
2. Sending delivery updates via SMS or email
3. Tagging orders based on delivery speed
4. Auto-generating new reorders for suppliers
5. Sending back in stock notifications based on tags

### Connect to Alloy

1. In Alloy, create a new workflow
2. Select any app you'd like to trigger the workflow. If you're a Shopify user, you'll likely want to connect Shopify Trigger and select an action like Orders Paid
3. After you choose a trigger, you can select a next block to add to your workflow. Here, you might want to directly select Skubana, or choose a utility block like Loop or Conditional Paths. These will allow you to create logic to filter or customize the data that is sent to Skubana
4. After selecting the Skubana block, you can choose an action
