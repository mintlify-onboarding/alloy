Ever find yourself in a position of needing to convert a file into a different format? We got you covered! We are proud to support our File Converter block which will allow you to make the following conversions:

* XML to JSON
* JSON to XML
* JSON to CSV
* XML to CSV

All you have to do is choose which conversion you are needing, plug in the current file input and that's it! Your file has now been converted.

Here in this example, you can see we are converting the entire JSON payload from an Amazon Seller Central Order into an XML file that we can stream to a specified destination.
