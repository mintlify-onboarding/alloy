In this article, you'll learn how to integrate AfterShip with 90+ other apps via Alloy's automation platform. Once you've connected AfterShip, you'll be able to pull or push data from tools like ReCharge, Yotpo, SMSBump & others that AfterShip doesn't support natively. 

### Example Use Cases

* **Shipment updates via text** \- When there is a shipment update, send a text to the customer via SMSBump, Tone, or Attentive
* **Update loyalty points** \- Once a shipment is processed, ensure appropriate loyalty points updates in apps like Stamped.io, Yotpo, & LoyaltyLion
* **Create re-engagement ticket** \- If a customer's order is shipped and they've left a bad review, create a ticket in Gorgias for a customer support rep to manually reach out to the customer.
