title: "Node.js SDK"
---

Our Node.js SDK allows you to easily setup, build, test, and go live with Alloy Embedded. Our SDK allows you to interface with our backend REST APIs in a quick and easy manner.

In this guide, we'll take a look at how to use the Node.js SDK.

---

## Installation

To install the Node SDK, run the following npm command.

`npm install alloy-node --save`

Once you have the SDK installed, import it into your file and authenticate it with your Embedded API key as seen in the code snippet below.

JavaScriptTypeScript

`const Alloy = require("alloy-node");
const alloy = new Alloy("YOUR_API_KEY");
`

`import * as Alloy from 'alloy-node';
const alloy = new Alloy('YOUR_API_KEY');
`

### Identifying Users

Now that you have the SDK installed and have properly configured your API Key, let's take a look at the `alloy.identify()` method. The `identify` method is how you tell Alloy Embedded who the current user is. You should pass along the `userId` as the argument to this method.

Let's take an example. Assume you want to list all workflows which your user has activated in his/her account. To do so, we'll first need to call `identify` first before making the call to list workflows. Your code snippet would look something like the following:

JavaScript

`await alloy.identify("userId");
await alloy.getWorkflows();
`

Note that the userId is stored temporarily so as long as the library is instantiated. Therefore, you can make subsequent invocations without needing to invoke `identify` each time. To clear out the currently identified user, invoke the `clear` method as seen below.

JavaScript

`await alloy.identify("userId");
await alloy.getWorkflows();
await alloy.clear();
`

---

## SDK Methods

### User

The User methods allow you to interact with user objects in Alloy Embedded. They correspond to their respective [REST APIs](/v2.0/reference/create-a-user).

#### Create User

Used to create a user object and returns a userId. Wrapper method for [this](/v2.0/reference/create-a-user) endpoint.

JavaScript

`await alloy.createUser({
  username: "gregg",
  fullName: "Gregg Mojica",
});
`

---

#### Batch Create Users

Allows you to create multiple users at once. Wrapper method for [this](/v2.0/reference/batch-create-users) endpoint.

JavaScript

`const data = {
  users: [
    {
      username: "user123",
      fullName: "Joe Smoe",
    },
    {
      username: "user456",
    },
    {
      username: "janedoe",
      fullName: "Jane Doe",
    },
    ...
  ],
};

await alloy.batchCreateUser(data);
`

---

#### List all Users

Returns an array of all the currently created user objects in your Embedded account. Wrapper method for [this](/v2.0/reference/list-all-users) endpoint.

JavaScript

`await alloy.getUsers();
`

---

#### Update User

Allows you to update a user. You can pass either a `fullName` or a new `username` or both. Wrapper method for [this](/v2.0/reference/update-a-user) endpoint. You must `identify` the user prior to invoking this endpoint.

JavaScript

`await alloy.identify("gregg");
await alloy.updateUser({
  "fullName":"Joe Smoe",
  "username": "joesmoe"
 });
`

---

#### Delete a User

Used to delete a user. This action cannot be undone. Wrapper method for [this](/v2.0/reference/delete-a-user) endpoint. You must `identify` the user prior to invoking this endpoint.

JavaScript

`await alloy.identify("gregg");

### Apps

The Apps method allows you to retrieve a list of currently supported apps in Alloy Embedded. Apps refer to the 3rd party connectors Alloy Embedded supports.

#### List Apps

JavaScript

`await alloy.identify("gregg");
await alloy.getApps();
`

---

### Integrations

The Apps method allows you to retrieve an array of all enabled Integrations available to your users. You must `identify` the user prior to invoking this endpoint.

#### List Integrations

JavaScript

`await alloy.identify("gregg");
await alloy.getIntegrations();
`

### Frontend Authentication

These methods are commonly used to render the workflows and generate the tokens needed to securely render the frontend Alloy Embedded modal.

#### Get Workflows for a User

`

#### Get User Token

Returns a JWT to securely render the Alloy Embedded modal. This token should be returned to the frontend and then passed into the frontend SDK. Wrapper method for [this](/v2.0/reference/generate-jwt-token) endpoint. You must `identify` the user prior to invoking this endpoint.

JavaScript

`await alloy.identify("gregg");
await alloy.getUserToken();
`

---

### Workflows

These methods allow you to manage workflows.

#### Get Workflows

Lists all available workflows in Alloy Embedded. Note this endpoint does _not_ return a list of workflows that the user has installed, but rather a list of all _available_ workflows. Wrapper method for [this](/v2.0/reference/list-workflows) endpoint. You must `identify` the user prior to invoking this endpoint.

JavaScript

`await alloy.identify("gregg");
await alloy.getWorkflows();

#### Deactivate a Workflow

Deactivates a specific workflow for a user. This endpoint is commonly used to turn off a workflow for a user after the user has installed it via the Alloy Embedded modal. Wrapper method for [this](/v2.0/reference/deactivate-a-workflow) endpoint. You can deactivate a workflow by its name _or_ `workflowId`. See examples below. You must `identify` the user prior to invoking this endpoint.

JavaScript

// Option #1
await alloy.deactivate({ workflowName: "My Workflow"});

// Option #2
await alloy.deactivate({ workflowId: "workfowId"});

Wrapper method for [this](/v2.0/reference/activate-a-workflow) endpoint. You can activate a workflow by its name _or_ `workflowId`. See examples below. You must `identify` the user prior to invoking this endpoint.

JavaScript

// Option #1
await alloy.activate({ workflowName: "My Workflow Name"});

// Option #2
await alloy.activate({ workflowId: "workfowId"});
`

---

#### Run a Workflow

Runs a specific workflow. 

This method runs a workflow that uses a **Webhook Trigger**. Note that this method cannot be used to invoke a workflow that has a _Custom Event_.

The method expects a `workflowName` _or_ `workflowId` as the first argument.

If you have defined a custom JSON body for the Webhook Trigger, it should be passed as the second argument.

 Wrapper method for [this](/v2.0/reference/run-workflow) endpoint. You must `identify` the user prior to invoking this endpoint.

JavaScript

`await alloy.identify("gregg");

// Option #1
await alloy.run("My Workflow Name", {

await alloy.run("My Workflow Id", {
  key1: "value1",  
  key2: "value2",
});
`

### Events

These methods help you returns events and invoke them. For more on events, read this [tutorial](/v2.0/docs/integrations).

#### Get Events

Lists all available events and their associated schemas which you have defined in Alloy Embedded. Wrapper method for [this](/v2.0/reference/list-events) endpoint.

JavaScript

`

---

#### Run Event

Runs a specific event for the currently identified user. Once invoked, this will invoke any workflows which contain the specified event. 

This method takes the name of the event as its first argument and the second argument should be the payload you intend to send to Alloy Embedded for this event. If no payload is required, you must send an empty array.

Wrapper method for [this](/v2.0/reference/run-event) endpoint.

JavaScript

`// Reference
await alloy.identify("gregg");
await alloy.event("Event Name", payload);

// Example Usage
await alloy.event("Order created", { "orderId": YOUR_SERVICE.orderId; });

Note that this method requires a `workflowId` of an active (child) workflow an executionId which can be returned from the `getWorkflowLogs` method. This method _does not_ accept a `workflowName`. Wrapper method for [this](/v2.0/reference/rerun-workfow) endpoint.
