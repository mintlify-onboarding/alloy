Sometimes, you may need to save data during a workflow for later use, either within the same workflow or in a separate one.

### Account Variables

Account Variables are stored at the Alloy Account Level, functioning like _global variables_ in programming. These values can be updated and are persistent. To choose from existing variables, click the **key** field, or create a new one by entering the name. For **value**, define a static string, json, or select other data from your workflow

Add more variables using **Set Another Variable**, click **Next, Refresh Output Data, and Show Output Data** to display your variables in a JSON format

### Variables

Regular variables exist only within a workflow execution context. They are created at runtime and destroyed after the workflow finishes executing. Create Variables similarly to account variables; however, you won't be able to choose from "existing" variables since they only exist at runtime.
