To connect to Alloy's UAPI, you'll need an API Key. You can easily obtain this by navigating to the **Settings** tab and then selecting **API Keys**.

For testing purposes, use your **Development** key. When you're ready to go live use your **Production** key. It's important to never share these keys with anyone outside your organization otherwise your account data can be compromised.

If you suspect your key has been compromised, regenerate your API key which will invalidate the previous key.

#### Using your API Key

To use your API Key, pass it in an authorization header as seen in the example request below:

cURL

`curl --request POST \
     --url 'https://embedded.runalloy.com/2023-03/one/webhooks?connectionId=YOUR_CONNECTION_ID' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data '{
         "address": "<YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL>",
         "scope": "commerce/customers"
     }'
`
