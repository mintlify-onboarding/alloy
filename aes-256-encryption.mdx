With the AES-256 Encryption block, you will be able to safely and securely send data to a destination of your choice where it can then be unencrypted. Below we will look at exactly how this is accomplished.

Enter your AES-256 Encryption Key to start the encryption process. Once you have supplied your key, you will be able to enter whatever text body it is that you are wanting to encrypt. Keep in mind this cannot be decrypted without the supplied encryption key.
