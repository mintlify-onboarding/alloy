Action blocks are what follow a trigger block in a workflow. There can be any number of consecutive action blocks after a trigger block, as long as they work to properly execute your desired workflow. 

There are two different types of action blocks:

### App Blocks

Similar to an app trigger, app blocks are also connected to apps and therefore, can perform actions using the apps you designated. The process to setting up an app block is similar to setting up the app trigger.

### Utility Blocks

Allow you to format text, perform math, and also perform a variety of other data operations based on the outputs of other blocks, which makes them slightly different from your typical block.
