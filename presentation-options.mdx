Alloy offers a number of ways to customize the look and feel of our product:

* **[Modal](/docs/embedded-modal)**: Use our frontend SDK to Embed the Embedded Modal into your product. This approach is discussed in the Quick Start guide.
* **[Embedded Link](/docs/embedded-link)**: Embedded link can be used in lieu of the Embedded Modal. Using Embedded Link, Alloy will generate a unique link (similar to a Google Doc) which can be shared for authentication.
* **[Headless](/docs/headless)**: If you want to fully customize Alloy Embedded, use our Headless option to programmatically generate credentials and securely pass them to our API.
