In this article, you'll learn how to set up your Google BigQuery account to work with the Alloy platform. 

To obtain credentials, you will need the following:

* Project Id
* Service Account Private Key JSON

As you can see below, Alloy will need this information to make queries to your Big Query instance. You'll want to copy/paste that information in Alloy once you have it. In this guide, we'll explore how to obtain these keys.

### How to get the Project Id

To obtain your project Id, navigate to your Google Cloud console's Projects List. You can do so [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-resource-manager?pli=1). Then, choose the Project ID of the project where your BigQuery is in.

### How to get the Service Account Private Key JSON

First things first, if you don’t have a service account yet, create a service account following Google’s Documentation [here](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts#creating).

Then follow the steps in Google’s Documentation [here](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys#creating) on how to create a private key in JSON format. See sample below showing how a private key in JSON format looks like.
