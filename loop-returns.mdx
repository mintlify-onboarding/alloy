In this article, you'll learn how to integrate Loop Returns with 90+ other apps via Alloy's automation platform. Once you've connected Loop Returns, you'll be able to pull or push data from tools like Yotpo, Postscript, & others that Loop doesn't support natively. 

### Example Use Cases

* Return points - When an item is returned, ensure appropriate loyalty points updates in apps like Stamped.io, Yotpo, & LoyaltyLion
* Create re-engagement ticket - If a customer issues a return and leaves a bad review, create a ticket in Gorgias for a customer support rep to manually reach out to the customer.
* Text campaign to save customer - Auto-generate an SMS follow up after a return is processed in the warehouse and send additional questions to the customer.
