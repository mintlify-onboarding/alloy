While some applications require you to make multiple queries to receive the desired data, others can only append data utilizing the PUT method. To avoid making multiple PUT requests, the Concatenate Objects block allows you to do this in one call. Doing this will also allow you to avoid potentially losing data by overwriting it in the off chance you failed to do a GET request before making one of the many API calls to update your desired data.
