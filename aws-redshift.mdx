In this article, you'll learn how to set up your AWS Redshift account to work with the Alloy platform.

For the credentials, you will need the following:

* AWS Access Key ID
* AWS Secret Access Key
* Redshift Cluster Identifier
* Redshift Database
* Redshift User
* Redshift Cluster Region

As you can see below, Alloy will need this information to make queries to your Pub/Sub instance. You'll want to copy/paste that information in Alloy once you have it. In this guide, we'll explore how to obtain these keys.

### How to get the AWS Access Key And Secret Access Key

Please follow the link to [set up your credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id%5Fcredentials%5Faccess-keys.html#Using%5FCreateAccessKey).

Make sure your IAM user has necessary permissions to access to AWS Redshift, the said cluster and database

### How to get the Redshift Details

To obtain your AWS Redshift details, first navigate to AWS Redshift and select the desired cluster.
