In this article, you'll learn how to set up your Google Pub/Sub account to work with the Alloy platform.

To obtain credentials, you will need the following:

* Project Id
* Service Account Private Key JSON

As you can see below, Alloy will need this information to make queries to your Pub/Sub instance. You'll want to copy/paste that information in Alloy once you have it. In this guide, we'll explore how to obtain these keys.
