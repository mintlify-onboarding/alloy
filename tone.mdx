### Example Use Cases

Send a text to a subscribed customer if item is on sale

1. Trigger emails or SMS messages based on a customer's review score
2. Send shipping and order updates via SMS
3. Send loyalty and referral links via SMS
4. Sending back in stock notifications based on tags

### Setup Instructions

1. In Alloy, create a new workflow
2. Select any app you'd like to trigger the workflow. If you're a Shopify user, you'll likely want to connect Shopify Trigger and select an action like Inventory Levels Updated

This way, you can send a specific list of customers a SMS notification through Tone.
2. Select Tone Messaging to then send an SMS with customer text to these customers
