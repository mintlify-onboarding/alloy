title: "Understanding Workflow Logs"
---

_Workflow_ Logs give users a retroactive view of their workflow. To access workflow logs, click the button to the left of Activate. _The Workflow Logs_ will update every time the workflow is run.

Users can look at the logs to:

* See the past changes in the workflow, by inspecting any input changes
* See the success or failure of logic blocks to better understand where the points of failure are, or to understand how to reconfigure workflows in the case of user error
