In this article, you'll learn how to integrate Attentive with 90+ other apps via Alloy's automation platform. Once you've connected Attentive, you'll be able to pull or push data from tools like ReCharge, Yotpo, SMSBump & others that AfterShip doesn't support natively. 

### Example Use Cases

* When a customer is created on Octane AI, create the subscriber in Attentive
* When a customer is updated in Octane AI, update the subscriber in Attentive
* Text a discount on next charge if a subscription is activated after a period of inactivity
