title: "Calculating Workflow Runs"
---

A workflow run is counted every time your entire workflow runs. This means that regardless of whether there were 2 blocks or 10 blocks in your workflow, every time the entire set of blocks in your workflow is executed, only 1 workflow run is counted. 

You can see the # of workflow runs for every workflow you have in your dashboard or in the workflow editor (highlighted in red).
