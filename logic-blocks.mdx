Logic blocks allow you to perform logic operations based on the outputs of other blocks. 

There are 3 types:

* **If-Else Condition:** This block lets you define a condition you want to check for before either proceeding on the True branch or the False branch of action.

**Branch Blocks:** Branch blocks allow you to perform different paths of logic depending on the output value of the previous block. There are 2 options for the "Which branches should execute?" field within the Branch Block:

* All branches with passing conditions
* Only first branch with passing conditions
