On your dashboard, at the top of the screen next to “My Workflows,” you can select “New Workflow.” You'll see two options: **Start From Recipe & Start From Scratch**.

1. **Start from Scratch**  
To build custom workflows, or start from scratch, you'll need to be on our Starter Plan or a higher tier.

To start, you'll want to select a Trigger Block so that your workflow has an activation point. You can learn more about trigger blocks here and other details about building workflows here.

1. **Start from Recipe**  
Recipes are available to all users. We have hundreds of these pre-built workflows ready for you to set up in minutes.
